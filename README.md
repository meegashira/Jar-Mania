Original game made in MIPS assembly code and created using the Mars Mips simulator as a final project for the course Computer Organization and Architecture offered at the Federal University of SÃ£o Paulo. This program requires the Keyboard and Display MMIO and the Bitmap Display to be connected to MIPS. To play the game, execute the main file JarMania12.asm using Mars.
